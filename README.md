# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview:
The purpose of the project was use bacterial data gathered from volunteers and put the data into a visualization identifying the top 10 bacterial species from their belly buttons. The dashboard function was designed for Test Subject ID to be selected and the visualizations would display results on varies charts.

  - Demographic Information
  - Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
  - Belly Button Washing Frequency
  - Bacteria Cultures Per Sample

## Resources:
JavaScript, VS Code, Plotly, d3, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JSON

## Results:
The process of writing code and building a functional Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard was achieved with the product of the dashboard image see below or by clicking on https://fernandoporras4444.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Summary:
This module challenge was exciting and a fun process of using Plotly charts and improving  customizing code with CSS whether it's changing font size, font color, or chart sizing. I would still say I'm rough around the edges with all this but definitely have a new skill sets to keep my knowledge moving forward.
